# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I choosed terminal-table for formatting my list. 

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I decided to recue each errors. 
  b) I added delete_items that allow to delete multiple items at once (since I already have this feature in udacitask1)
  c) I added todo_should_be_done_for that return all the todo item that should be done before a certain date. Can be helpfull.
  d) I added a remove_past_items! that remove all the past items from a list. Allow user to do some cleanup.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
Something like 3 hours, and I decided to submit. I saw lot of caveat and lot of think that can be done in a better way, but it's like it will never end if I added everything I have in mind. 
Hmmm... final one more hour to refactor and add the Item superclass, that I feel is the good way to do, no ? In fact it wath strange to have lot of logic regarding the Item in udacilist directly.


2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Think to have a Item super class

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
	See part 1 

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
Lot of place: 

- I think I can have better validation of my arguments at the begenning of each method.
- It will be nie to add some test, some method begin to be hard to valudate just by 'manual' testing. 
- Better documentation, I do lot of effort to be descriptive in my comment but some times I feel like I just repeat the code of the method in a human... I feel like saying 
'Returns X if Y and Z if A' is little bit useless. 
- With the same idea I neeed to improve my commit message some time it is not really explicit and some other my commit is just to big, so many feature in one commit.
